* Javascript strings can be chained together with the + method.
  * `'my name is roy ' + ' and john' === 'my name is roy and john'`

###Handy Functions

* There are multiple instances where we would want to change strings to a number for mathematical reasons..
  * `.parseFloat( )` returns a floating point number
  * `.parseInt( )` returns a whole number
  * both take the value to be converted as a parameter
  * you can also prepend the string with a + sign to convert it to a number (+number)
    * this can sometimes be tricky
* `.toString( )` not exactly used on strings but used to change any object into a string
