* access to both `.pop` and `.push` methods just like ruby.
* `.splits` and `.joins` work much like ruby as well
* `.slice(startNumber, endNumber)` will extract the words.
  * also used to copy an array from one variable to another
    * if done with simple `=` it is a pointer, not a copy

###Looping

* `.length()`1 method is handy for finding the overal length of an array
* `arrayName[indexNumber]` will output whatever is at that specific point in the array
* It is better resource wise to set a variable to the array length and compare the iteration to it
* `for(var i = 0; count = array.length, i < count; i++){}`

###Strings

* string are basically just groups of arrays
  * this means we can grab characters out of a string with an array index

###Dimensions

* The idea of an array in an array...so fucking Inception
* To access these values: `arrayName[0][0]`

###Associative

* Think about [ruby hashes][0]
* `var myHash = {key1: val1, key2: val2}`
* looping over these arrays is really easy with the [`for in` array][1]
