* Pages where the content is time based
* Pages whose content depends on session information. For example, if you customize pages for each of your users, you’re unlikely to be able to cache them
* Pages generated from data that you don’t control. For example, a page displaying information from our database might not be cachable if non- Rails applications can update that database too
