###Notes

###Behavior Driven Design/Dev

* Software fails because projects are late or customers don't know what they want or over budget, or hard to maintain
* The above problems are easily trumped with the Agile Lifecycle because everyone is involved continuously
* Maintain a working prototype with working revisions
* The word behavior is because you ask about behavior of app (small parts) during development
* Done with user stories through a kanban or 3/5 card system
* Written in [connextra format][1]
* 3/5 cards are easy and nonthreatening therefore all stakeholders can brainstorm
* Real systems have 100s of features
* _Backlog_: a collection of User Stories not yet implemented

###User Stories

* All user stories should be `SMART`
* Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant(Business whys), Timeboxed(Know when to give up)
* Each scenario __should__ be testable
* Adjectives used: Given, When, Then (we know this already)
* Estimate what's achievable using velocity
* Each story assigned and estimate of points (3 point scale) based on difficulty
* Velocity == Points completed per iteration
* Always ask "Why" in a recursive manner until the business value is discovered or ultimately killed ([5 why's][2])
