###Notes

###Behavior Driven Design/Dev

* Software fails because projects are late or customers don't know what they want or over budget, or hard to maintain
* The above problems are easily trumped with the Agile Lifecycle because everyone is involved continuously
* Maintain a working prototype with working revisions
* The word behavior is because you ask about behavior of app (small parts) during development
* Done with user stories through a kanban or 3/5 card system
* Written in [connextra format][1]
