Some basic things that are easily forgotten over time

* Do loops execute at least once. This is different from while loops which have the potential to never fire
* [Js Switch Statement][1]
* JavaScript short circuits `&&` and the `||` operators
  * this means that if Js evaluates `||` and the first operator is `TRUE` then it stops and calls the condition `TRUE`
  * with the `&&` operator if the first value evaluates to `FALSE` then the whole thing is `FALSE`
