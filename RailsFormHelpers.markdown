Form Helpers are aware of model objects that can be passed to and from certain models. These are dovtailed with Form Tag Helpers. Some of these Form Helpers include: `*label for="model_type" `- outputs an html label tag

* `text_field` - much like it sounds, outputs a small text field to input data
* `text_area` - much like text_field except it outputs a large box. Container good for housing a blog post.
