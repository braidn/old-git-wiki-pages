* Unexpected short-lived code is considered an epic failure
* Waterfall design process is considered "Big Design Up Front"
  * Done in different phases with different groups dealing with each group
  * Hardware is done in this model
    * this is probably the reason why software began with this model
  * Works well for:
    * Software with specs that never change.
  * Big problem is that you build one version AND then you realize how to build the real program
* Agile model:
  * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  * Individual and interactions over processes & tools
  * Working software over comprehensive documentation
  * Responsive to change over following a plan
  * Continuous improvements over phases
  * TDD based design
  * [Velocity][1] to measure team progress
