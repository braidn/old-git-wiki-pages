###Method Pattern

* When a function is defined as a method on an object

~~~
var Object {
  billy: function(param1, param2) {
};
~~~~

* `this` is used to retrieve or modify values within the object
  * called public methods

###Function Pattern

* Defining a function outside of an object.
* `this` works very odd in these functions, it is bound to the global object over the function itself.
