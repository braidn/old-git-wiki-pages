###Undefined

* Indicates that there are no step definitions for the scenario

###Pending

* Indicates a step definition that is half way through being implemented / finished
* You can write a descriptive need in the do/end block by using: `pending("something descriptive")`
  * Kind of like a handy cucumber to-do list
