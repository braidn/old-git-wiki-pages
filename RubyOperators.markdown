nearly all of Ruby's operators can be override; accept: `and`, `or`, `not`, `&&`, `||`. These are fixed in Ruby.

* The `+` and `-` can be both unary and binary.
  * to set the unary operation of these two items call a method to: `+@` or `-@`
* Operator modding is odd, keep things strait and remember if you reverse things, will it blow up in your face?
